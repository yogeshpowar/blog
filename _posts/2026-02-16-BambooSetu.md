desc: A Cycle Ride to Jayatpada

On the 14th, eleven of us - cyclists from [NCRunners](https://ncrunners.in) -  set out for a two-day cycling journey to [Jayatpada](/blog/assets/images/bambooSetu/route.jpeg), a remote village located about 21 km beyond Bhor towards the Bhatghar Dam, and roughly 75 km from Pune.

We began at 6:45 AM, riding through quiet roads and layered landscapes. Our first halt was at Nasrapur around 8:00 AM for breakfast (Misal Offcourse). By 10:30 AM, we reached Bhor, visited the historic Bhor Wada, and the serene Mahadev Temple behind it, before continuing towards Jayatpada.

## Bamboo Setu & the Village Context

We were accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. Kashid, who run [Bamboo Setu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kGVpJSvJcJLG4hCd6) — a cooperative initiative that leases land from villagers to develop bamboo plantations, creating livelihood opportunities and promoting bamboo-based solutions for the community.

I had visited this place a year earlier while exploring bamboo for building an isometric dome, and that earlier connection prompted this visit. Jayatpada is remote—no mobile network, limited connectivity—but still has electricity. Architecturally and culturally, the village remains rooted in its traditional form: mud houses, stone walls, lime plaster, and functional layouts that reflect an older, sustainable way of living.

In two villages en route, Pasoore and Velvand's locals welcomed and felicitated us. These interactions were meant to showcase ongoing village development efforts and their expectations from CSR initiatives.

While CSR funds have indeed reached these villages—visible in temples, schools, hostels, and concrete infrastructure—it was hard to miss a deeper issue. In many cases, the purpose seems diluted. Infrastructure has been built, but systems, ownership, and long-term sustainability appear neglected. Cement and concrete alone don’t create development.

## Life in Jayatpada

We reached Bamboo Setu around 2:00 PM, had a simple vegetarian lunch—bhakri, rice, and local preparations—by 3:00 PM, rested briefly, played cricket, and then explored the village.

Jayatpada is small and calm:

* Traditional wadas built 50-60 years ago
* Designed to house cows and bullocks indoors during monsoons
* Fodder stored on upper floors
* Wide homes built for agrarian, self-sufficient living

Today, however, most young adults have migrated to Pune or Mumbai. Some grandparents stay back with grandchildren. Agriculture and animal husbandry are no longer viable livelihoods due to lack of manpower. Families survive largely on remittances from cities.

There are a few resorts have come up on the back-water and people are hired for daily wages (500-700 Rs per day) especially ladies for house keeping and other chores.

Yet, people are warm, welcoming, and deeply humane. This is the true face of India.

## School, Hostel & Hard Truths

Before dinner, we visited a school and hostel nearby and interacted with students and teachers. What we observed was concerning.

The challenges here cannot be solved by inspirational talks alone:

* Students lack exposure and clarity
* Parents struggle to guide; as most of them are working in cities and have no time to guide their children.
* School and hostel management face structural issues; much of the time they were talking about skill development and vocational training to the stundents who are 6-8th standard. Rather they should be talking about basic education and life skills.
* CSR-funded buildings exist, but academic, emotional, and mentorship systems are weak

Still, our group did what we could—one-on-one conversations, open discussions about education and life, simply trying to lift morale and offer perspective.

## Night in the Village

Dinner was simple but with a variety of vegetables. Tea earlier had been without milk, reflecting declining cattle ownership.

Post-dinner, we lit a bonfire and then split into two groups to sleep in village homes.

The other group stayed in a traditional mud–lime–stone house—surprisingly warm.

We slept on floor mattresses. At night:

* A milk cat quietly settled near us
* Goats bleated nearby
* Chickens and hens slept inside the home

It felt like being part of nature, not isolated from it. So different from metropolitan living, where doors shut and neighbours disappear.

## Morning & Return

Morning began with hot water heated on a chulha, burnt with firewood, served in the veranda. We were asked to drink it because the groundwater was icy cold. Small gestures, deep care.

After tea, we started our return ride around 7:45–8:00 AM, halting at Bhor for breakfast at Shri Ganesh Hotel, an old establishment dating back to 1980. Samosas, kachoris, and snacks filled us up like lunch—simple food, modest bill.

We reached home by 2:00 PM.

## The Ride Itself

* Distance: 75 km
* Elevation gain: 1,000 meters+ on each side
* Terrain: relentless ups and downs, especially punishing in the last 20 km

We had decided to take no support vehicle and do it ourselves (DIY). Gald that we did it without any punctures or injuries.

Despite fatigue and depleted energy, everyone completed the ride safely and on time.

## The Larger Thought

Jayatpada is not short of money. It is not lacking goodwill. It is not devoid of effort. What it truly needs is time, attention, guidance, and continuity.

For those of us settled in cities—comfortable, resource-rich—weekends like these matter. Visiting such villages, understanding their realities, and offering knowledge, mentorship, and sustained engagement can create far more impact than one-time funding.

People like Mr. and Mrs. Kashid are already doing meaningful work—not for themselves, but for the community.

```
Perhaps the next step is coalition, not charity.
Presence, not just projects.
```

This ride reminded us that development is not about structures - it's about people.
