... and How PROTO Can Help

AI is no longer just answering coding questions - it's writing real features,
fixing bugs, and even managing entire projects. AI Tools show us what's possible
when agents collaborate with developers.

But here's the problem:
1. The workflows are chaotic.
2. Agents lose context between sessions.
3. Documentation drifts out of sync with code.
4. Tests are often skipped in the rush for speed.
5. Human oversight happens too late (or not at all).

Without structure, agentic coding risks becoming an endless loop of patchwork
scripts and abandoned branches.

What has worked for me so far is a **PROTO** - a simple, repeatable protocol for
agentic coding workflows.

## Why PROTO Works

1. Anchor Points for Agents
	1. Instead of starting "from scratch" each time, agents know to begin with
	   PROTO.md, TODO.md, and context.md.
	2. This keeps history and future tasks visible, reducing drift.
2. Human-in-the-Loop by Design
	1. At key points, PROTO requires human review.
	2. Agents don't "run away" with logic - they collaborate in controlled loops.
3. TDD Mindset (Lightweight or Full)
	1. Tests aren't optional. Even in Lite mode, agents define expected outcomes
	   first.
	2. This anchors implementation in verifiable behavior.
4. Continuous Documentation
	1. Instead of docs being an afterthought, PROTO builds README.md and
	   context.md updates into the cycle.
	2. Future agents (or humans) don't start blind.
5. Adaptable Modes
	1. Full PROTO = production-grade workflow (strong on rigor, testing,
	   documentation).
	2. Lite PROTO = hackathon/prototyping workflow (fast, minimal, still
       traceable).
6. No Vendor Lock-In
	1. Here's the key difference: you don’t need a team subscription to a fancy
       agent platform.
	2. Sharing the context (context.md) and the plan (TODO.md) is enough for
	   continuity.
	3. Any agent (or human) can pick up the repo and immediately know what’s
	   done, what’s next, and what the system looks like now.
	4. Subscriptions may give dashboards and analytics, but PROTO makes the
	   workflow itself free, open, and portable.

## The Payoff
* For developers: less chaos, more clarity.
* For agents: consistent entry points and predictable feedback loops.
* For teams: a shared standard that bridges speed with maintainability.

I've published the first version of PROTO (Full + Lite). My hope is that it
becomes a foundation others can build on, adapt, and improve.
