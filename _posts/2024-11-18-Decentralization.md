desc: Why decentralization is the need of the hour

Looking back at the events of the past decade, one can’t help but wonder:

- What will the future look like for us as individuals?
- Where is our society headed by 2050?

These were the questions a friend posed to me recently, sparking a deep
reflection. Here’s my attempt to peer into the future.

### The Technological Tides That Shape Us

Human history has been continuously shaped by groundbreaking inventions. From
the printing press to gunpowder, each innovation disrupted the status quo,
leaving an indelible mark not only on its creators but on the entire world.

The past two decades have been dominated by the rise of information
technology—transitioning from dot-coms to cloud computing, from telephones to
mobile devices, and now to wearables. Unlike earlier innovations that took time
to spread through communities and countries, today’s advancements spread at the
speed of light.

Take ChatGPT, for instance: an AI tool available to anyone, anywhere in the
world. The globe has truly become a village, connected in ways unimaginable
before.

### The Growing Grip of Big Tech

This hyper-connectivity has its downsides. A handful of tech giants now wield
unparalleled power. For instance, companies like Google and Meta (formerly
Facebook), though headquartered in the USA, operate globally, from Europe and
Asia to Africa and even Antarctica.

Their scale enables them to invest in massive research and innovation, creating
barriers for smaller players or startups. As a result, the global market risks
turning into a monopoly controlled by a few corporate giants.

Governments in some regions, being over powered by them, have opted for
partnerships between big tech and local players. For example, Google and Meta
have invested in Jio in India, leveraging its local presence to tap into the
vast consumer base.

### The Ripple Effect on Society

The effects of centralization extend far beyond technology:

- **Education and Learning**: Traditional knowledge-based education systems are
  losing relevance in a world where information is instantly accessible. The
  challenge now is to equip individuals with skills that foster critical
  thinking, creativity, collaboration and the change. (4 Cs).
- **Agriculture and Automation**: With advances in robotics and drone
  technology, farming could become fully automated, leading to cheaper produce.
  However, this would displace small-scale farmers and render large sections of
  the workforce economically redundant, shifting their roles from producers to
  mere consumers.
- **Economic Inequality**: Capitalism, while driving innovation, has
  concentrated wealth in the hands of a few. This profit-driven model risks
  alienating the lower strata of society, turning them into pawns in a
  centralized, monolithic economy.

### A Call for Decentralization

This isn’t a battle against technology or corporations—it’s a challenge to the
centralization model that further worsen the inequality and discards grassroots
participation. For more ore inclusive future, we must:

#### 1. **Break Centralization and Embrace Decentralization**

Promote businesses and solutions that are decentralized by design, fostering
diversity and resilience in the economy.

#### 2. **Champion Open Source and Open Architecture**

Support open-source initiatives that prioritize transparency and collaboration.
Open architectures encourage innovation by allowing contributions from
individuals and communities worldwide.

#### 3. **Encourage Local Production**

While locally produced goods may be costlier or lack uniform quality, supporting
them is a responsibility. It sustains local economies and reduces reliance on
monopolistic global supply chains.

#### 4. **Raise Awareness and Build Skills**

Decentralization is not the easy path—it requires effort, grit, and an
understanding of its importance. Education plays a vital role in raising
awareness and equipping individuals with the skills needed to thrive in a
decentralized world.

### Finding Balance

The goal is not to reject progress but to ensure that technological advancements
coexist with respect for humanity and equity. True progress lies in balancing
innovation with compassion, enabling every individual to lead a meaningful life.

The nationalist approach to addressing this issue is straightforward in theory:
clone, adapt, or learn from the global giants and reverse-engineer their
solutions to fit the needs of a specific nation. However, this is far easier
said than done. The global market operates on systems that have evolved
organically over time, rather than being explicitly designed. As a result,
reverse-engineering these complex structures is highly challenging and requires
significant talent and resources.

The decentralize models is beyond a nation even suited for Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam.

```
अयं निजः परो वेति गणना लघुचेतसाम्।
उदारचरितानां तु वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम्॥
```

The future is ours to shape—let’s decentralize it.
