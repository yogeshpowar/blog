title: "The Hidden Trap of AI Tools"

desc: When Power Becomes a Distraction

AI tools today give us a feeling of extreme power. With a single prompt, we can
generate working code, design a UI, or even spin up a whole prototype. It feels
like we can do *everything*.

But that's also the bait. And many teams are walking straight into the trap.

## The Drift Beyond Your Domain

Have you noticed this in your own team?

- A *DevOps engineer* suddenly building a web form to collect data.
- A *backend developer* diving into mobile app code.
- A *designer* hacking backend logic because the AI "made it easy."

At first glance, this doesn't look like a problem. In fact, it often impresses
people:

- AI-generated code compiles.
- A prototype works "end-to-end."
- Non-experts are wowed because something runs.

But scratch the surface, and you'll see two serious risks:

1. **Prototype illusion**
	- The first version built with AI looks good to outsiders but often lacks the
    depth, structure, and safeguards an expert would expect. It's a *demo*,
    not a solution.
    - Research calls this the "illusion of completeness": convincing outputs that
    mask hidden engineering work still needed.

2. **Domain time-swapping**
	- People start chasing domains where they have little expertise. That drains
    time away from solving the *real* problems in their own domain.
    - Studies on "automation bias" show we tend to trust machine outputs too
    much, which worsens when working outside our area of strength.

## Final Thought

AI tools are here to stay. They are accelerators - but accelerators don't
replace steering wheels.

The most effective teams will:
- Use AI to *go faster in their domain*, not to wander into everyone else's.
- Value *depth with AI augmentation*, not shallow breadth with AI crutches.
- Build prototypes with AI, but move to production only under expert guidance.
