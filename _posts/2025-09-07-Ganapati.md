If the aim of the Sarvajanik Ganapati Utsav (सार्वजनिक गणपती उत्सव) was to unite
Hindus, then it has largely achieved its purpose. It gave Hindus their own
public festival where the masses could participate in celebrations, without
having to join similar processions from other religions (e.g., Muharram).
History shows several references where peaceful Hindu processions were
interrupted, and this festival became a strong cultural response.

Over time, however, the festival has taken a somewhat different direction. The
original purpose of uniting Hindus may have been fulfilled to a large extent,
but today it is often shaped more by popular culture and fashion than by
community building. Many mandals, especially in bigger cities, now spend
lavishly on setups that have only a short life. For example, crores of rupees
are spent on Dekhava (देखावा) - elaborate decorations and structures that are
dismantled after ten days. Art and culture certainly have an important place in
society, but there should perhaps be a healthy balance. Moving from traditional
decorations to light shows, motorized displays, and now AI-powered attractions
raises the question of how much is really necessary.

If excess funds are available, they could also be used to strengthen the
original aim of uniting Hindus across all parts of Bharat, rather than being
concentrated mainly in Pune or Mumbai. A 72+ hour procession with DJs and LED
displays may add excitement, but it does not always contribute to building
stronger communities. Many of the songs played are popular but sometimes
meaningless or even vulgar (अश्लील) in nature. If it is only the beats that
matter, then why not give more importance to our Paramparik Dhol-Tasha
(परंपरिक ढोल-ताशा) or similar local instruments, which carry much deeper
cultural value?

If supporting the local economy is also an aim, then it would be more
beneficial if the funds reached a larger group of people rather than only a few
individuals who charge lakhs of rupees for DJ vehicles. The same money could
support hundreds of traditional drummers and artists who keep our heritage alive.

There are still many regions in India where even peaceful processions are not
possible. Energy and money could be directed towards making such gatherings
safe and inclusive everywhere. After all, Decentralisation has always been one
of the natural features of Hindu traditions.

Recently, I was watching Lalbaugcha Raja (लालबागचा राजा)’s Atyadhunik Tarafa
(अत्याधुनिक तराफा) - an ultra-modern setup built in Gujarat - and it did not work
as well as expected. This is not about Gujarat itself, but about how difficult
it can be to create something truly meaningful when the focus shifts too much
towards spectacle. At the same time, there are excellent examples of how
Ganapati festivals can be managed - coming not from Pune or Mumbai, but from
places like Dhule (धुळे) and Akola (अकोला). There, processions were carried
outwithout DJs or electronic music, only with traditional instruments. In some
places, immersions were done in artificial water tanks (कृत्रिम जलतलाव) to avoid
 polluting rivers and lakes.

I remain convinced that public festivals like Ganesh Utsav (गणेश उत्सव) are
essential. They give youth and the masses a space to channel their energy. But
it would be even more meaningful if such celebrations uplifted individual souls,
maintained peace in society, and respected nature. Dancing to DJs or indulging
in alcohol and tobacco may bring momentary fun, but it does not fully match the
deeper purpose of the festival.

गणपती बाप्पा मोरया, पुढच्या वर्षी लवकर या।
